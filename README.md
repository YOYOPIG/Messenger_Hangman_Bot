# Hangman for Messenger
Hi! This is a Facebook Messenger chatbot program allowing you to play the famous word guessing game "Hangman". In this program, you can chat with the bot with the following messages:

 - **start** : To start the game
 - **help** : Show the rules of the game
 - **what** : What is Hangman?
 - **Or just say hi  to the bot** : Any greetings such as hi, hello is fine, the bot will give you further instructions :)

After the game started, you can try to guess the word with the following methods:

 - **Guess a letter** : The bot will tell you whether the letter is in the word or not.
 - **Guess the whole word** : You can guess the whole word as well. Keep this in mind : you will also lose a chance if you miss!
